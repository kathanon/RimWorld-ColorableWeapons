	<description>Makes all weapons colorable.

This just sets the attribute that allows coloring, a mod that adds some way to actually color it is required. Craft With Color lets you select the color while crafting, but any other mod that does something similar should work.

Works with all vanilla weapons, and any modded weapon that uses the vanilla base definitions. Some weapons look better than others when colored, it depends on the texture.

Safe to add to a game in progress. If removed from a game in progress, it may cause a one-time error.</description>
